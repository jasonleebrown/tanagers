Tangible Niche & Demographic Simulator: TANAGERS is a GRASS GIS package where users sculpt 3D landscapes and simulate ecological and evolutionary processes.  TANAGERS  incorporates tactile learning with real-time ecology and evolution simulations in an interactive, visually dynamic way.  Working with the Tangible Landscape infrastructure, which represents a real-time feedback cycle of hands-on interaction, 3D scanning, geospatial computation and projection, we have created a highly interactive way to explore how physical geography and species-specific life history factors effect population ecology, genetic diversity, and speciation across a landscape.
